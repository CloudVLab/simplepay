= simplepay (Rails Amazon Simple Pay Interface)

http://simplepay.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem provides a Rails interface to the Amazon Simple Pay payment service.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Supports the following Amazon Simple Pay services:

* Standard
* Subscription

The following services are coming someday (hopefully soon):

* Donation
* Marketplace

== SYNOPSIS:

Configure the gem with your Amazon credentials:

  (in config/initializers/simplepay.rb)
  
  Simplepay.aws_access_key_id     = 'MYAMAZONACCESSKEYID'
  Simplepay.aws_secret_access_key = 'MYAMAZONSECRETACCESSKEY'
  Simplepay.account_id            = 'ACCOUNTIDFORAMAZONPAYMENTS'

Generally, this library will then be used directly from one (or more) of your 
views, like so:

  <%= simplepay_form_for(:standard, {
    :amount       => 10.95,
    :description  => "Profit!"
  }) %>
  
  <%= simplepay_form_for(:subscription, {
    :amount                 => 10.95,
    :description            => "MORE Profit!",
    :recurring_frequency    => "1 month"
  }) %>
